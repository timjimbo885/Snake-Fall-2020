    <p class = "summary">This project was quite enjoyable, but I decided to take a differnt approach
        than usual. Usually I would study the starter code and work from there, which I did in the beginning,
        but given my passion to do gamedesign, I started from the beginning using multiple tutorials, and of course
        w3schools. Upon reading the requirements, a linked list was not used here, I worked with linked lists in data structures,
        but the concept did not line up with how I was creating the game. Instead I created an array, that spawns the snake, and uses
        the x and y axis to help draw and build the snake. Using unshift() and pop() to both add parts to the snake and remove parts in the 
        update snake method. This proved easier with drawing the snake and creating the changing direction method. One of my challenges was 
        the createFood() function. Figuring out how to draw food in the game at a random location, after digging around, math.random provides
        a random number between 0 and 1, but if we use the canvas size and multiply the numbers, we can get a random number within the canvas. Figuring
        out how to end the game as well was challenging, that required some help, but with the array, if the array coordinates of x and y were passing
        the canvas or colliding within itself, the game would end. The main() I used a setTimeoutfunction, which I learned in game development, constantly
        updating the game and we use this to change the speed of the snake. One of my challenges that I realized very late I had was changing the tail 
        color of the snake. I attempted building that code here, by taking the length of the array and subtracting 1, we would have the tail.
        But with my drawSnake method, I used the forEach function, which checks every element in the array, so changing the last color would change the entire
        function. Overall even though I did not use linked list, I am very proud of what I created and I believed using arrays creates a more functional
        and simpler game.
